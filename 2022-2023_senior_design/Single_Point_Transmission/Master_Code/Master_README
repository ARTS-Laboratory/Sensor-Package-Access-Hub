The master.py code in this folder was written as a modified version of a file with the same name in smhassanerfani's Horus repo. 
To successfully use master.py, one should first download the Horus repo at the link: https://github.com/smhassanerfani/horus
Then, the master.py code should be placed after navigating to RPi_Cron_Job -> rf24.
This should allow the master.py script to access all of the files it needs to properly receive a point of data from the a sensor package.

The CSV Reader code represents an initial attempt at transferring more than one data point. 
This code is not currently functioning, but can serve as the basis for further attempts to transfer multiple data points.
