# Sensor-Package-Access-Hub (2023-2024 Senior Design Project)

## Accel_tockn
* Working sensor code. Only gathers accelerometer data and stores it in SD card

## Sensor_Package_Code:

* 1st attempt at transmitting accelerometer data (failed)

## Working One Way Data Transmission:

* Successful data transmission from Teensy to Teensy
* Contains Sensor Package code and serial outputting receiver
* PCB Design Folder contains PCB schematics for the working iteration of the code.
* Raspberry Pi Code contains working code for the waystation operating using Teensy to Teensy/Pi
